USD-IRR Exchange Rate Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and the Iranian Rial (IRR) using time series analysis and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. The goal is to analyze historical exchange rate data and provide accurate forecasts to assist stakeholders in making informed financial decisions.

Overview
Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze time-ordered data points. In this project, we employ ARIMA models to capture the underlying patterns in USD-IRR exchange rate fluctuations. By fitting the model to historical data, we aim to forecast future exchange rates and help businesses and investors manage currency risk effectively.

Key Features
Data Collection: Historical USD-IRR exchange rate data is sourced from reliable financial databases.
Time Series Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the exchange rate data.
ARIMA Model Implementation: The ARIMA model is utilized to fit the time series data, optimize parameters (p, d, q), and generate forecasts.
Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy is assessed using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Graphical representations of actual vs. predicted exchange rates and analysis of forecasted trends.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical calculations
Statsmodels for ARIMA modeling
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
